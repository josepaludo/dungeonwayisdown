Turn Based "Card Game" Dungeon Crawler Game Idea

            - Universal Imputs: 'help' for list of commands, 'log' for last
            events, 'cards' for cards functionality, 'status' for life of
            every player, weapons, damage dealt to enemies, 'more help' for
            more help, 'icons' for the meaning of each symbol

- Thig: major class in game, almost everything is a Thing. X, Y and symbol 
properties.
    - How can a Thing have a 2x2 coordinate? That is, 2 values for both X and Y?
    How to check distance? (function than when checks for XY values checks if is 
    integer, yada yada.)

- Living: Is Thing, inherits X, Y and Symbol atributes. Have health and speed 
property.

- Enemy: Is Living. Inherits Thing and Living properties. Have move and attack
method. Target property.
    - Set target method: Chooses a random player target, which will be it's 
    target until otherwise. Must have target attribute.
    - Move Method: If distance from target == 0, return. For every location, if 
    valid (not hole or wall), if it makes target closer, move there. If no valid 
    move, make same loop but for center.
    - Various weapons with different ranges, damages, names, etc.

- Ally: Is Living. can be target of Enemies.

- Player: is Ally. Is controlled. Specs: Warrior, Priest, Druid, Wizard, Thief.
Have the Hand property where strings that represent abilities are stored.

    - Warrior: tank, can taunt, takes less damage.
    - Priest: healer, can't attack.
    - Druid: support, deals damage but also have utilities, can transform itself 
    and others, can summon.
    - Wizard: damage, AOE, summon.
    transform
    - Thief: damage, glass cannon, can get invisible.
    
    - New Cards Method: random(between 0 and 1). 0 = nothing, <5 = 2 weak cards,
    <7.5 = 1 medium 1 weak cards, <9 = 2 medium cards, <10 1 strong 1 medium 
    cards, 10 = 2 strong cards. This goes to everybody

- Board: 20x20 Matrix (10 lines with 10 elements each). Displays (only displays 
each thing's symbol and it X and Y values.
    - Spawn: Enemies will spawn at random locations on the opposite side of the 
    board compared to players' spawning place. Players always spawn side to side
    close to the wall, in a "door" where they can't come back to (the dungeon 
    way is down). Exits are doors to other rooms' entrances.
    - Display Location Method: Must have a list of Things, in which there is 
    lists of Enemies, Allies and Nonlivings, or it is a list of all this things. 
    Get X, Y and symbol properties of all Things, place symbols at locations.
        - Must also print the last 5 or 10 major events, such as damage dealt, 
        what the enemy said, who moved where. Must be a distinction between 
        important events and uninportant
    - Random Nonlivings Method: How to generate random nonlivings? Make reserved 
    area in which things can't be placed, like around entrances and exits?
    Suggestion: check which wall is free, flip coin if yes put a randint by 
    randint close to the wall.
    - Holes: If someone or something falls into a hole, it disappears.

- Loop: when an exit is reached by all players, the level is terminated, a new 
one is generated with entrance at the opposite wall side (up x down, left x 
right).
    - Every Round, players get new cards.
    - Every event happens blinking: loop range 10: print board as is, sleep 0.3
    seconds, print board as will be, sleep 0.3 seconds. Then board as is is 
    equal to boar as will be.
