	*** make a minimum distance variable ***
	*** check if dead function ***
	*** reduce target max counter
	*** enemy move checks which places get it closer to target, chose at
	random, if no one, choses one at random(only here he can fall)
	*** enemy move check if can move ***
	*** make a clear checker functions function ***
	*** check dead players?? ***
        *** change player movement ***
        *** make a counter, every 5th level make a boss ***
        *** make items you can iterract with ***
        *** chests have effects: gain life, lose life, gain movements, love
        movements
        *** make a txt with all info to help players, better than on IDE
	*** make a countdown for dead players, if reaches 0, he can't be
	revived
