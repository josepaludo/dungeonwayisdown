TODO: 
        *** what to do with livings ***
        *** get livings info ***
        
        *** change init enemy with board to get info every turn ***
        
        *** forgot to do something with check coord ***
        
        *** adjust enemy turn ***
        
        *** make a counter, every 5th level make a boss ***
        
        *** make items you can iterract with ***
        
        *** what to do about the symbols?

        *** change check if dead function to give object, not name, or not

Doing now:
    - Do veloster after
    - Refactor allies, enemies, players, livings
    - board will have reference for eveything
    
    - board reviewed

    - only use board_blink
