Dungeon Way is Down

Turn Based "Card Game" Dungeon Crawler Game Idea


TODO: 
        *** must check if player is dead after every enemy damage ***
        *** something is wrong with warrior swing axw ***
        
        *** make a counter, every 5th level make a boss ***
        
        *** make items you can iterract with ***
        
        *** what to do about the symbols?

Doing now:
    - Do veloster after
    - Refactor allies, enemies, players, livings
    - board will have reference for eveything
    
    - board reviewed
    - check enemy targets and movement
    - only use board_blink

    - "v": fast enemy, changes target quickly, but doesn't do much damage, melee
    - sting, does 1 damage and 2 damage every turn for the next 3 turns

    - "o": orc enemy, medium speed, medium damage, high defense, melee
    - "g": goblin, high speed, casts bombs from afar, ranged
    - "y": troll enemy, slow, high damage, trows rocks from afar, ranged
    
    - "B" generic boss, must make specific bosses, like V, Ç, O, G
