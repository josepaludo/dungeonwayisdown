Turn Based "Card Game" Dungeon Crawler Game Idea


TODO: 
    *** FOR TESTING, IM ONLY CREATING WARRIOR ***




    - Warrior: tank, can taunt, takes less damage.
    - Priest: healer, can't attack.
    - Druid: support, deals damage but also have utilities, can transform itself 
    and others, can summon.
    - Wizard: damage, AOE, summon.
    transform
    - Thief: damage, glass cannon, can get invisible.

DOING NOW:

    - Do wek_as_f (W):
        + input for direction
            + get udlr coords func
            + get udlr line coords
            + get around coords by range
                (if range> difference bettween end of map and coord, pass)
        + check direction coordinates
        + (see if any other func already does it)
        + make a function that does it
        + makes x flash on it
        + (coordinate on backup board == x)
        + see if any enemy is on coordinate
        + if yes, enemy health -= damage
        + makes log of damage
        + if enemy health < 0, enemy dies
        + makes log of death
        + coord = empty square
